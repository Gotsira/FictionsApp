    "title": "Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix",
    "description": "Elixir and OTP provide exceptional tools to build rock-solid back-end applications that scale. In this book, you’ll build a web application in a radically different way, with a back end that holds application state. You’ll use persistent Phoenix Channel connections instead of HTTP’s request-response, and create the full application in distinct, decoupled layers. In Part 1, start by building the business logic as a separate application, without Phoenix. Model the application domain with Elixir functions and simple data structures. By keeping state in memory instead of a database, you can reduce latency and simplify your code. In Part 2, add in the GenServer Behaviour to make managing in-memory state a breeze. Create a supervision tree to boost fault tolerance while separating error handling from business logic.Phoenix is a modern web framework you can layer on top of business logic while keeping the two completely decoupled.

    "title": "A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms",
    "description": "Algorithms and data structures are much more than abstract concepts. Mastering them enables you to write code that runs faster and more efficiently, which is particularly important for today’s web and mobile apps. This book takes a practical approach to data structures and algorithms, with techniques and real-world scenarios that you can use in your daily production code. Graphics and examples make these computer science concepts understandable and relevant. You can use these techniques with any language; examples in the book are in JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Use Big O notation, the primary tool for evaluating algorithms, to measure and articulate the efficiency of your code, and modify your algorithm to make it faster. Find out how your choice of arrays, linked lists, and hash tables can dramatically affect the code you write. Use recursion to solve tricky problems and create algorithms that run exponentially faster than the alternatives.",

    "title": "Scalable Cloud Ops with Fugue",
    "description": "Cloud computing represents the greatest shift in computing in more than a decade. But the promise of the cloud is unrealized. The cloud isn’t just about shedding the physical data center—it’s about shedding the data center mindset. Cloud infrastructure can be controlled via API calls. This means we can view it as a giant general-purpose computer—and program it. That’s where the Fugue operating system and the Ludwig language come in. They automate the creation, operation, enforcement, and termination of infrastructure in the cloud. This definitive Fugue guide starts with a simple website and moves on to a more robust application with evolving infrastructure needs as you walk through the steps to harnessing the cloud. With Amazon Web Services, launch infrastructure quickly. Debug in design time. Automate deployment and enforcement of your cloud. Centralize your change control process and automate continuous auditing. Rest easy knowing configuration drift.",

    "title": "Programming Elixir 1.3",
    "description": "Functional programming techniques help you manage the complexities of today’s real-world, concurrent systems; maximize uptime; and manage security. Enter Elixir, with its modern, Ruby-like, extendable syntax, compile and runtime evaluation, hygienic macro system, and more. But, just as importantly, Elixir brings a sense of enjoyment to parallel, functional programming. Your applications become fun to work with, and the language encourages you to experiment. Part 1 covers the basics of writing sequential Elixir programs. We’ll look at the language, the tools, and the conventions. Part 2 uses these skills to start writing concurrent code—applications that use all the cores on your machine, or all the machines on your network! And we do it both with and without OTP. Part 3 looks at the more advanced features of the language, from DSLs and code generation to extending the syntax. This edition is fully updated with all the new features of Elixir 1.6.",
